# 🔗 HTTPS vs SSH vs GitHub CLI (IN SIMPLE WORDS)

When you connect your **local system to GitHub**, GitHub gives **3 ways**.

---

## 1️⃣ HTTPS (⭐ BEST FOR BEGINNERS)

👉 **Use THIS**

Example:

```
https://github.com/username/SDC-NodeJS-Lab.git
```

### What it means:

* Like logging into Gmail using **username + password**
* GitHub opens browser and asks you to **authorize**

### Why use HTTPS?

✔ Easiest
✔ No setup
✔ Best for students & labs

📌 **Recommended for SDC / college labs**

---

## 2️⃣ SSH (For Advanced Users)

Example:

```
git@github.com:username/SDC-NodeJS-Lab.git
```

### What it means:

* Uses **key-based login** (no password)
* Requires:

  * SSH key generation
  * GitHub setup

### Why NOT for beginners?

❌ Confusing
❌ Extra setup
❌ Errors common in labs

👉 **Not recommended for students now**

---

## 3️⃣ GitHub CLI (Advanced Tool)

Example:

```bash
gh repo clone username/SDC-NodeJS-Lab
```

### What it means:

* Command-line app by GitHub
* Requires installation & login

👉 Useful for professionals, **not needed for labs**

---

## 🏆 FINAL SIMPLE RULE (TELL STUDENTS)

> “Always copy **HTTPS URL**. Ignore SSH and CLI.”

---

## 📌 One-Line Explanation You Can Say in Class

> “HTTPS is simple browser-based login. SSH and CLI are advanced and we don’t use them now.”

---

## ✅ What YOU Should Do Now

1. Copy **HTTPS URL**
2. Use:

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/SDC-NodeJS-Lab.git
```
